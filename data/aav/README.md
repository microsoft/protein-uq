### Dataset description

The original sequence from the aav study is UniProt [P03135](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P03135). A copy of the wildtype sequence can be found in this folder as P03135.fasta
On the reference sequence, mutations where introduced starting from region `[561, 588]`, which reflects the AA sequence: `DEEEIRTTNPVATEQYGSVSTNLQRGNR`.

All splits come in two modalities: `regression` and `binary`. The latter is obtained by applying a cutoff on the regression split.


### Full dataset

The full dataset can be found in the zipped CSV `full_data.csv.zip`. All "splits" are derivatives of this CSV. The columns in the CSV are:

- `mutation_mask`: the mutation mask applied to the reference region. small chars mean insertions, `*` means delition, capital letters mean mutations, `_` means no change
- `mutated_region`: the AA sequence of the mutated region. Can contain special characters, like `*`, reflecting the `mutation_mask`
- `category`: the category of the sequence, e.g. designed or not
- `number_of_mutations`: the number of mutations according to the original dataset
- `levenshtein_distance`: the Levenshtein distance between the `mutated_region` and the reference sequence
- `score`: the `GAS1_virus_S` score from the original dataset, here selected as the target score. Note that the `GAS1_virus_S` has been averaged over all synonymous variants.
- `full_aa_sequence`: the sequence from [P03135](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P03135) with the region `[561, 588]` replaced by the `mutated_region`
- `binary_score`: a binarization of the `score`, according to a Gaussian mixture model, as done in the original publication.
- `reference_region`: the reference region, as above.
- Additional columns to create splits (see following)

### Splits

We define as "des" all those sequences in partitions: `'previous_chip_viable', 'previous_chip_nonviable', 'stop', 'singles', 'single', 'designed', 'wild_type', 'random_doubles'`.
On the other hand, "mut" are sequences in all other partitions (designed through machine learning).

Splits ([semaphore legend](../../README.md#split-semaphore)):
- ðŸŸ¢ `des_mut`: `train` if in "des", `test` otherwise 
- ðŸŸ¢ `mut_des`: `train` if in "mut", `test` otherwise
- ðŸŸ¢ `one_vs_many`: `train` if in "des" with `levenshtein_distance <= 1` , `test` if in "des" with `levenshtein_distance > 1`
- ðŸŸ¢ `two_vs_many`: `train` if in "des" with `levenshtein_distance <= 2` , `test` if in "des" with `levenshtein_distance > 2`
- ðŸŸ¢ `seven_vs_many`: `train` if in "des" with `levenshtein_distance <= 7` , `test` if in "des" with `levenshtein_distance > 7`
- ðŸŸ¢ `low_vs_high`: `train` if in "des" with `score` below or equal WT, `test` if in "des" with `score` above WT.
- ðŸŸ  `sampled`: `train` for 80% of data in "des", `test` for the remaining 20% in "des"

All splits are contained in the `splits.zip` file. These are CSV with colums:

- `sequence`: the AA sequence. May contain special characters!
- `target`: the prediction target, which is float value (the split is a regression).
- `set`: either `train` or `test`, if the sequence should be used for training or testing your model!
- `validation`: When `True`, these are sequences for train that may be used for validation (e.g. early stopping).
